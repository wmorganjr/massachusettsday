<span class="georgia"><strong>History of Massachusetts Day and Who the Founders Are</strong><br /><br />

After a year of living in Texas, Kevin Feldman excitely embarked on an extended trip back to his home state of Massachusetts in 2012. It was on this trip when the idea of Massachusetts literally came in the form of a dream: Go to a random town in Massachusetts for the day. It was a simple few hours of random fun with friends in the only state that Kevin could ever honestly call home.<br />After fleshing out the idea, Kevin identified what excited him about the concept. It wasn't the choosing of a random place, it was the trust in my friends to make the best of it with me, no matter how it turned out. <br />
Now, I just had to see if this idea had any legs. <br /><br />

<strong>Eli Rosinha</strong> was all-in before Kevin even finished describing what he had in mind. To this date, he has been to all incarnations of Massachusetts Day.<br /><br />

I actually found the conversation from my Gchat history when I told <strong>Will Mogan</strong> about Massachusetts Day:
 June 8th, 2012 <br />
<br />
</span><span class="other">me: I revealed my Summer of Adventure idea to Eli yesterday, seemed to go over well for him.<br />
  Will: what was that?<br />
  me: We gather a group of people who are into this idea together early one morning, probably a Sunday, everyone that is in HAS to do this, no backing out<br /><br />
  <em> 2:00 PM <br />
  we pick a number out of a hat or some other method like it. <br />
  the number will correspond with a random town or city in MA.<br />
  we have to spend the day there<br />
  its called Massachusetts Day<br />
<br />
  </span></em><span class="georgia"> <br />
Will, of course, did come out for the day. He also when above and beyonnd by creating this very website. He took my idea of picking a name of a hat and quickly wrote the famous Massachusetts Day app you see on the main page. Without this feature, I can't imagine introducing this concept to new people. Will gave us the legitimacy that we didn't know that we needed.

Next on board was<strong> Meghan Ariagno</strong>. Meg is the kindest and most supportive person that I have ever met. She was so excited to come out for this thing. She is the biggest cheerleader for Massachusetts Day and to have her as one of the founders gives me so much joy.<br />
<br />
This thing would never have happened or continued to happen if it wasn't for all three of these people. <br /><br />

A number of people really were excited for the idea but were convieniently busy when Sunday, June 1st rolled around.  </span>
